# About PioGrowth

App for analysis of optical density (OD) measurements
produced mainly with a [PioReactor](https://pioreactor.com/)

It was created on the basis of three individual apps

- [milnus/pioreactor_turbidostat_shiny](https://github.com/milnus/pioreactor_turbidostat_shiny)
- [milnus/Batch_analysis](https://github.com/milnus/Batch_analysis)
- [milnus/OD_calibration_bioreactor](https://github.com/milnus/OD_calibration_bioreactor)

The code translated to Python was based on the original R code from the Shiny apps.


## Use Cases
It can be used to analyze readouts and save summarized information of the
raw optical density (OD) measurements, which are `600nm` wave length measurements commonly
used in microbiology and biotechnology applications with micro-organisms like yeast or 
bacteria.
