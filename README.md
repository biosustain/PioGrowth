# PioGrowth

Repository for Streamlit app for analysis of optical density (OD) measurements
produced mainly with a [PioReactor](https://pioreactor.com/)

It was created on the basis of three individual apps

- [milnus/pioreactor_turbidostat_shiny](https://github.com/milnus/pioreactor_turbidostat_shiny)
- [milnus/Batch_analysis](https://github.com/milnus/Batch_analysis)
- [milnus/OD_calibration_bioreactor](https://github.com/milnus/OD_calibration_bioreactor)

The code translated to Python was based on the original R code from the Shiny apps.

## Install and start app

In a new environment you can install the app using the app's
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)

```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

Start the app from the root of the repository (as it's done on Streamlit Cloud):

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

## Development environment

Install package so that new code is picked up in a restared python interpreter:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## History

The joint app combining three Shiny apps for PioReactor tools was started as the
three individual apps mentioned above using shiny, but never completed. You can find the
last development version in the original repository of this fork
(see: [milnus/PioGrowth](https://github.com/milnus/PioGrowth)).
